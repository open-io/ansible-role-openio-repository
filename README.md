# Ansible role `repository`

An Ansible role for setup OpenIO's repositories (and OpenStack). Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- Setup key and repository for an OpenIO product and a specific distribution
- Manage credentials for private repositories

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.4+

## Role Variables

| Variable   | Default | Comments (type)  |
| :---       | :---    | :---             |

| `openio_repository_products` | `{'sds': {'release': '17.04'}}` | OpenIO products repositories to setup |

The `openio_repository_products` variable should be a dict, with OpenIO products repository names ('sds', 'oiofs', 'replicator') as keys.

Each `openio_repository_products`s value should also be a dict, with the following content:

| Key   | Default | Comments (type)  |
